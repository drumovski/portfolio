                    <p>After my first week of coder academy, I was introduced to the command line. Pretty cool stuff but
                        it doesn’t come naturally to Windows.
                    </p>
                    <p>The good people at my Coder Academy course suggested running a virtual machine to run Linux.
                        Sounds like a reasonable idea. However while attempting to install Ubuntu onto my laptop, on a
                        virtual box, I ran into some problems. The keyboard refused to work half way into the install.
                        After trawling the internet for solutions, I came across a few people with the same issues.
                        Unfortunately none of the solutions seemed to be getting me anywhere. But then I thought outside
                        the box… what do I do with windows on this laptop, that I wouldn’t be able to do with Linux? Why
                        do I need Windows at all?
                    </p>
                    <p>This is going to be my developer computer. I’m not going to play any games on it. I’ve got my
                        desktop computer anyway… what can’t I do on Linux?</p>

                    <p>Nothing.</p>

                    <p>I. Don’t. Need. Windows.</p>

                    <p>The realisation was very satisfying. So that’s it. I’m giving Windows the flick. Googling issues
                        that people have had installing Ubuntu on my Lenovo Z570 came up with a couple of issues with
                        the wifi and graphics card driver but we’ll see if they rear their ugly heads.
                        <em>I’m doing this.</em></p>

                    <p>Ok. Skip ahead an hour or so and here we are. No issues. Works perfectly. Love the Gnome GUI but
                        I’m looking forward to familiarising myself with the terminal interface even more. I think I’m
                        now officially a Linux/Ubuntu fanboi. That didn’t take long did it?</p>

                    <p>Bye Windows. You won’t be missed.</p>

                    <p>Well I’m 47 but I still think that I’m not old. My young children may disagree but I don’t care.
                        And this is why I’ve decided to start a new career as a Web Developer.

                        It all started when I was talking to a friend who is a developer, he mentioned that they had
                        hired some people straight out of some coding boot-camps… Interesting.

                        Maybe I could do this? After all, I’m not a stranger to coding. I’ve done a couple of websites
                        and learned some stuff online. I started investigating boot-camps and I liked the look of Coder
                        Academy.
                        The thing that stood out for me and ended up tipping the scales was the fact that the course was
                        accredited. At the end of it, I would have a diploma in IT if nothing else. My journey was
                        taking shape.

                        After applying, I found out they have a diversity scholarship. Me having one leg and all, I
                        thought why not give it a go right? And what do you know? I got it! My journey started with a
                        Sherpa!

                        Unfortunately, Covid 19 reared its ugly head and a course that was meant to be face to face
                        suddenly turned online.

                        Kudos to the Coder Academy team though. Hey, If anyone can transform a course to an online
                        experience in less than a week it’s going to be them.

                        Unfortunately, my back has given out again and I’m trying to learn while horizontal. It’s not
                        ideal but hopefully things will improve shortly.
                        So here I am, just finished the first week and have an inkling of Command Line and a smidge of
                        Ruby but am super excited and have a thirst for more. Stay tuned.

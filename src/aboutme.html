                    This was a video I submitted to Coder Academy in an application for a scholarship.
                    It details my life so far and the reasons I wanted to become a coder.
                    Thankfully, the scholarship was successful and I now have a Diploma in IT with HD's in all subjects.

                <p>
                    I thought I would get into coding after I left school. I did computing in year 12, at Scotch College
                    in Perth. It was my favourite subject. I got the scores that allowed me into the course I wanted in
                    University – Information Systems at Curtain University in Perth. However, it was the wrong course
                    for me at the time. I soon discovered that I did not like the business side of it. There was too
                    much business and not enough programming. I ended up leaving the course half way through. At that
                    point, if I had chosen another course that was more focused on coding, I’m quite sure my life would
                    have taken a completely different direction. But I chose to try something a little more creative.
                    I’ve always had a good visual eye so I thought I would give photography a go. I specifically liked
                    film and TV so I thought the photography would be a good background for Cinematography. I should
                    also mention at this point I had tried becoming a pilot and ran out of money very quickly. Becoming
                    a pilot is an extraordinarily expensive thing to do. Since I had tried two things and failed, I felt
                    like I needed to stick at the photography whether I enjoyed it or not. I was tired of quitting
                    things. I enrolled in a TAFE course – Diploma of applied science in photography with a minor in
                    cinematography. Thankfully, I enjoyed it very much and did end up finishing it. However, life always
                    has a way of throwing curve balls.
                <p>
                    I found out that I had a natural ability to play the drums. The first time I sat in front of a drum
                    kit, I could play. I joined a couple of bands and had some fun but it wasn’t until one fateful night
                    that I was filming a gig for a band called Sundiata that I saw Effigy. They were performing their
                    very first gig supporting the band that I was filming. There was Pete on guitar and Annie on Bass in
                    front of a bed sheet with a logo painted on. It wasn’t a plain bed sheet either, it had a pattern on
                    it. But I was impressed. The bands I was in before were incredibly badly organised. I was the only
                    one with a car and it was like herding cats just to rehearse. These guys had a gig and didn’t even
                    have a drummer. Pete had an old drum machine that he didn’t know how to program so at the start of
                    each song, he’d turn it on and after they finished he’d turn it off again. I’ve never seen a band
                    more in need of a drummer. I was also very impressed with their original songs and they were the
                    only Perth band I’d ever heard doing pixies covers. I was in love. Anyway, I went up to them after
                    the gig and told them that they needed me. Fate agreed and away we went. We played a number of gigs
                    in Perth and got quite a following. We also had the attention of a Record Company – Roadrunner
                    Records who were based in the Netherlands but had an Australian contingent in Melbourne. They
                    decided to sign us to a five record deal. Now Perth has a very strange culture. Perth crowds don’t
                    respect you if you’re local. The idea is I think, that if you don’t make it out of Perth, then you
                    can’t be any good. They only respect bands that come from the Eastern States. Given the record
                    company were based in Melbourne, Melbourne is the music capital of Australia, and I had just
                    finished my photography diploma, there was a unanimous decision that the band should move to
                    Melbourne. So we did.

                    We all lived together in a house in North Carlton. We recorded 2 CD’s. We toured around most of the
                    capital cities and quite a few regional towns as well. We had high rotation on Triple J for a number
                    of our tracks. We made music videos, we were on Recovery, Hey Hey it’s Saturday, some other TV
                    appearances. It was a lot of fun. There is a thing called lead singer syndrome however. And Pete had
                    that in spades. He wouldn’t let anyone else write songs, and he was not a nice guy to work with.
                    Eventually, Annie quit, then we got a new bass player and after a while, both she and I quit
                    together. Pete went on to form about five different line-ups but people kept quitting on him. I
                    think he’s still doing solo stuff but I don’t really keep in touch.

                    After that I wanted to get back into Cinematography. I managed to get an attachment (which is like a
                    government funded mini apprenticeship) in the camera department on a TV show that was just starting
                    called the Secret Life of Us. Lucky for me, the guy whose job I was learning turned out to be a bit
                    of a schmuck and no one asked him back for the second season, so I got the job. I went on to do 4
                    seasons of the show and became a reasonable camera assistant. I worked on other TV shows, short
                    films, commercials, music videos, as well as my own short films. I even managed to get shortlisted
                    for Tropfest in 2006 with a short film called ‘Bouncing Betty,’ named after a landmine that explodes
                    after you step off it and it jumps into the air. The story follows an unwitting soldier who steps on
                    a bouncing betty. He manages to dig it up without it exploding and has a plan to put it under a rock
                    but then steps on another one. He manages to wrangle the first one against his helmet while holding
                    the other one against his foot and hoping on the other foot. Then he hops on another one and that’s
                    where it ends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did enjoy my time in Film and TV but the hours were very taxing and I decided I wasn’t cut out for
                    freelancing and having to continually look for work. I wanted a job with more security. I wasn’t
                    ready to go back to study so I joined Netspace as a Customer Service Officer. It was during this
                    time that life threw me another curve ball.
                </p>
                <p>I was riding my bicycle to work one day and turned left just after a garbage truck. Unfortunately,
                    the truck then turned left again into a driveway and didn’t see me. I couldn’t stop in time and the
                    bike and my right leg ended up going under the back wheels. My leg was a bit of a mess but the foot
                    was intact. They carted me off to hospital and the doctors were poking my foot asking if I could
                    feel it and I felt nothing. The nerve had been severed. They told me that I would be looking at
                    surgery after surgery to try and re-attach the nerve and I’d likely never be able to walk very well
                    again or… they amputate, so I signed the form, gave them the ok and woke up without the lower part
                    of my leg. On the positive side, it hasn’t slowed me down much and it’s given me a new empathy for
                    others living with a disability.</p>
                <p>Since then I have gone on to marry and have two wonderful kids; Marshall (7) and Aria (5). I’ve even
                    introduced Marshall to a coding game on the tablet called Light Bot and he really liked it. I’ll
                    make a coder out of him yet.</p>
                <p>I’ve always kept up my interest in computers and taught myself coding through online courses in HTTP,
                    CSS, Javascript and a bit of PHP. I wanted to make my own website for my photography work as well as
                    the bands that I currently play in so that was a good motivation for me. They were basically built
                    from scratch and I put bare bones WordPress functionality in so they could be updated easily by
                    other band members. Neither band has done very much in the last few years so they haven’t been
                    updated in a while. It doesn’t help when everyone has young children but we get together when we
                    can.</p>
                <p>I was quite proud a Microsoft Outlook script I created for a company I worked for called Brunel
                    Chauffeur Drive. I noticed an inefficiency in the way the company crosschecked passenger lists
                    between the airlines and the company’s own passenger lists. I developed an automated script that ran
                    from a rule in Microsoft Outlook to read emails and highlight specific words. This made critical
                    emails containing large amounts of unformatted data much easier to read and interpret. I
                    successfully developed the script, demonstrated its effectiveness to my manager, and then
                    implemented its use across the organisation. It is still used today, saving the company valuable
                    time and increasing accuracy tremendously. My initiative was recognised by senior management for
                    contributing to improved business efficiency for the company.</p>
                <p>I’ve had my fingers in a lot of pies. Drumming, Photography, Film Making, Customer Service, Training,
                    and Administration. However, the one thing that I set out to do after I left school, the one thing I
                    have been most suited for, I have yet to actually do. So what I’m about to start in earnest, is my
                    life as a coder.</p>
